# PomodoroLapse
Python scripts I used to produce time lapses of images of the tomatoes I've been growing in my windows sill.

Requires python 3, 64-bit (32-bit does not have sufficient memory available) and https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/. Having a machine with plenty of ram (+8GB) makes this script a lot easier to run. 

I have about 20GB of images of my tomatoes which can be downloaded here and used with the scripts. When I ran the scripts I came across a few invalid files which crashed the script, but I have not been able remove the files from the image repository yet, so be aware that might happen.
